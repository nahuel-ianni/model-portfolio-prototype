## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Make sure your machine has the following frameworks installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)


### Installing
In order to have a working copy for development purposes, you need to install the project dependencies, specified on the src folder

```
$ cd src
$ npm install
```

You should now be ready to work on the project.  
You can start the development server using Node

```
$ cd src
$ npm run serve
```

This will allow you to navigate to the website, by default on http://localhost:8080

More scripts, including deployment and test, can be found [here](./src/src/README.md).


## Deployment
A production version of the project can be created and deployed on the `docs` folder, which bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```
$ cd src
$ npm run build
```


## Built with
The application was created using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), HTML 5 and CSS 3.
